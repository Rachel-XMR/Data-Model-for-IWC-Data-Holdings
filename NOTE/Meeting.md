# 2.18 
## Summary
Key Topics Discussed:
1. Documentation & Task Allocation:
  - Emphasized the importance of thorough documentation to prevent data gaps and facilitate smooth handoffs.
  - Tasks include data visualization, identifying data gaps, and designing data models. Flexibility is allowed in handling Objectives 3 and 4, with the latter noted as lower priority.
  - Team members are encouraged to choose tasks aligned with their skills/learning goals. Options include collaborative work or dividing data sources (vessel strikes, strandings, bycatch, marine debris).
2. Data Sources & Proposals:
  - Global Stranding Database: Central for tracking marine mammal health (e.g., avian flu outbreaks) and feeding into related databases (vessel strikes, bycatch).
  - Vessel Strikes: Example datasets shared (e.g., yacht racing incidents), with sensitivity around vessel/individual identifiers.
  - Bycatch & Marine Debris: Data pending from coordinators; marine debris may rely on opportunistic sightings (e.g., wildlife interactions with plastic).
  - Pollution Data: Under discussion, with potential inclusion pending stakeholder input.
3. Challenges & Sensitivities:
  - Data Gaps: Limited participation from member countries in reporting strandings/bycatch.
  - Sensitive Data: Vessel names, reporter details, and graphic stranding images must remain confidential.
  - Delays: U.S. data contributions on hold; marine debris/pollution data streams still unclear.
4. Next Steps & Action Items:
  - Review Data: Explore provided datasets (OneDrive) and external sources (e.g., public marine debris observations).
  - Task Division: Use group chat/Google Doc to coordinate roles and compile questions.
  - Prepare for Next Meeting: Address data structure assessments (e.g., standardizing date/location fields) and timeline adjustments if needed.
Flexibility & Outcomes:
- Multiple outputs (e.g., data models, dashboards) are acceptable. Focus on skill development and actionable prototypes for funding proposals.
- Adjust timelines as needed; Speaker 1 will assist in data retrieval and stakeholder follow-ups.
Key Contacts:
- Speaker 1 for data access/clarifications.
- Nuno for data security guidelines.
Next Meeting: Discuss task progress, challenges, and refine objectives/timelines.
