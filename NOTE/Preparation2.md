## Data model design


- Modular design ensures that the data model can be flexibly extended
- Consider the multi-dimensionality of data (e.g., time, space, species, event type, etc.)
- Ensure that the data model supports efficient data query and analysis.


## Visualisation:

Interactive visualisations allow users to filter and explore data according to their needs
