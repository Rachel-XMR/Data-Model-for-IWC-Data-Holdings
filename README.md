## Brief description
The IWC Scientific Committee and Conservation Committee works in areas of stranding, vessel strike, bycatch, marine debris and entanglement and uses data from these areas to assess, manage and conserve cetacean populations, some of which are severely impacted by human activities. The data from these work areas have varying degrees of development already implemented. Some have developed global databases, while others have developed regional and country databases. The current state of the various data holdings does not allow for easy integration, the project undertaken will be to assess the various databases and datasets, design a data model for integration and develop potential data access opportunities.


## objectives of Project:
- identify, assess and document data sources.:
      inked to tasks such as parsing through collated datasets and exploring online for additional datasets. Then documenting the capabilities and limitations of the datasets for integrating into a data warehouse
- design data model, data pipeline and data integration process.
      research in database development and data integration methods to propose a design, or multiple design options, for a data model.
- develop data visualisation products.
      assess integrated datasets to develop draft data visualisation products to share with stakeholders and allow for data exploration by stakeholders.
- identify data gaps to focus future activities.
      related to the 3rd as a gap analysis can assist the stakeholders to set priorities for gathering new and existing data. A Gap Analysis consists of mapping data layers in space and time to identify knowledge gaps.

## Expected outcomes

-	A folder of datasets collated during the project and a document describing the datasets.
-	A document describing the data model and data flow.
- Tools to communicate the integrated data with stakeholders.
-	A gap analysis report.
